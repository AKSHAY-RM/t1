Subject: Request for Renewal of Half Day Casual Leave

Dear [EDP Manager's Name],

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue with my attendance for 05/09/2024. On 20/09/2024, I noticed that my attendance for 05/09/2024 showed an odd punch. To correct this and ensure an even punch, I deleted one of the punches on the same day.

However, after the system was updated on 23/09/2024, my punches for 05/09/2024 were recorded as even. Since I had already deleted one punch, the system now reflects an odd punch again and has subsequently deducted half a day of casual leave from my account.

I kindly request you to renew the half day of casual leave deducted due to this error.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Subject: Request for Reinstatement of Half Day Casual Leave

Dear [EDP Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally bring to your attention an issue concerning my attendance record for 05/09/2024.

On 20/09/2024, upon reviewing my attendance, I observed an irregularity with an odd punch recorded on 05/09/2024. To rectify this and ensure my punches were in order, I deleted one of the odd punches on the same day. However, following the system update on 23/09/2024, my attendance for 05/09/2024 was correctly recorded as an even punch. As a result of my earlier manual deletion, the system has now registered my punches as odd once again, leading to the deduction of half a day of casual leave.

In light of this, I kindly request the reinstatement of my half-day casual leave, as the deduction was made due to a system discrepancy.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and thank you in advance for your support.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
